    "# TPOT in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will learn how to use a very unique library in python: `TPOT`. The reason why this library is unique is that it automates the entire Machine Learning pipeline and provides you with the best performing machine learning model. `TPOT` is one of the most popular package in Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) - since it is effective and free to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, you will learn:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The idea behind Automated Machine Learning\n",
    "- How TPOT uses Genetic Programming to select the best machine learning model\n",
    "- Using TPOT on a dataset in Python\n",
    "- Limitations of TPOT\n",

    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a lot of components you have to consider before solving a machine learning problem some of which includes *data preparation*, *feature selection*, *feature engineering*, *model selection and validation*, *hyperparameter tuning*, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "In theory, you can find and apply a plethora of techniques for each of these components, but they all might perform differently for different datasets. The challenge is to find the best performing combination of techniques so that you can minimize the error in your predictions. This is the main reason that nowadays people are working to develop **Auto-ML algorithms** and platforms so that anyone, without any machine learning expertise, can build models without spending much time or effort. \n",
    "\n",
    "One such platform is available as a python library: **TPOT**. You can consider **TPOT** your Data Science Assistant. TPOT is a python Automated Machine Learning tool that optimizes *machine learning pipelines* using genetic programming. It will automate the most tedious part of machine learning by intelligently exploring thousands of possible pipelines to find the best one for your data.\n",

    "# Installation\n",
    "To install tpot on your system, you can run the command **sudo pip install tpot** on command line terminal or check out this [link](http://epistasislab.github.io/tpot/installing/). tpot is built on top of several existing Python libraries, including **numpy**, **scipy**, **scikit-learn**, **DEAP**, **update_checker**, **tqdm**, **stopit**, and **pandas**. Most of the necessary Python packages can be installed via the [Anaconda Python distribution](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), or you could install them separately also. Optionally, you can also install **XGBoost** [here](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/xgboost-in-python) if you would like tpot to use the eXtreme Gradient Boosting models."

    "# Genetic Programming\n",
    "With the right data, computing power and machine learning model you can discover a solution to any problem, but knowing which model to use can be challenging for you as there are so many of them like *Decision Trees*, *SVM*, *KNN*, etc. That's where genetic programming can be of great use and provide help. Genetic algorithms are inspired by the Darwinian process of Natural Selection, and they are used to generate solutions to optimization and search problems in computer science.\n",
    "\n",
    "Broadly speaking, Genetic Algorithms have three properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Selection: You have a population of possible solutions to a given problem and a fitness function. At every iteration, you evaluate how to fit each solution with your fitness function.\n",
    "- Crossover: Then you select the fittest ones and perform crossover to create a new population.\n",
    "- Mutation: You take those children and mutate them with some random modification and repeat the process until you get the fittest or best solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Genetic Programming itself is a big topic in computer science but if you wish to go deeper into genetic algorithms, check out this video series.\n",
    "\n",
    "***But how does this all fit into data science?***\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, it turns out that choosing the right machine learning model and all the best hyperparameters for that model is itself an optimization problem for which genetic programming can be used. The Python library tpot built on top of scikit-learn uses genetic programming to optimize your machine learning pipeline. For instance, in machine learning, after preparing your data you need to know what features to input to your model and how you should construct those features. Once you have those features, you input them into your model to train on, and then you tune your hyperparameters to get the optimal results. Instead of doing this all by yourselves through trial and error, TPOT automates these steps for you with genetic programming and outputs the optimal code for you when it's done."

    "\n",
    "**TPOTClassifier** has a wide variety of parameters, and you can read all about them here. But the most notable ones you must know are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- generations: Number of iterations to the run pipeline optimization process. The default is `100`.\n",
    "- population_size: Number of individuals to retain in the genetic programming population every generation. The default is `100`.\n",
    "- offspring_size: Number of offspring to produce in each genetic programming generation. The default is `100`.\n",
    "- mutation_rate: Mutation rate for the genetic programming algorithm in the range `[0.0, 1.0]`. This parameter tells the GP algorithm how many pipelines to apply random changes to every generation. Default is `0.9`.\n",
    "- crossover_rate: Crossover rate for the genetic programming algorithm in the range `[0.0, 1.0]`. This parameter tells the genetic programming algorithm how many pipelines to \"breed\" every generation.\n",
    "- scoring: Function used to evaluate the quality of a given pipeline for the classification problem like `accuracy, average_precision, roc_auc, recall`, etc. The default is `accuracy`.\n",
    "- cv: Cross-validation strategy used when evaluating pipelines. The default is `5`.\n",
    "- random_state: The seed of the pseudo-random number generator used in TPOT. Use this parameter to make sure that TPOT will give you the same results each time you run it against the same data set with that seed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also note mutation_rate + crossover_rate cannot exceed **1.0**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here you will use tpot with generations = 5 and the rest of the parameters at default values. The parameter verbosity = 2 states how much information TPOT communicates while it's running.\n",

    "\n",
    "Note running the code in the below cell will take several hours to finish. With the given TPOT settings (5 generations with 100 population size), TPOT will evaluate 500 pipeline configurations before finishing. To put this number into context, think about a grid search of 500 hyperparameter combinations for a machine learning algorithm and how long that grid search will take. That is 500 model configurations to evaluate with 5-fold cross-validation, which means that roughly 2500 models are fit and evaluated on the training data in one grid search. That's a time-consuming procedure! Later, you will get to know about some more arguments that you can pass to TPOTClassifier to control the execution time for TPOT to finish.\n",

    "# Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **TPOT can take a long time to finish its search**\n",
    "\n",
    "Running TPOT isn’t as simple as fitting one model on the dataset. It is considering multiple machine learning algorithms (random forests, linear models, SVMs, etc.) in a pipeline with numerous preprocessing steps (missing value imputation, scaling, PCA, feature selection, etc.), the hyper-parameters for all of the models and preprocessing steps, as well as multiple ways to ensemble or stack the algorithms within the pipeline. That’s why it usually takes a long time to execute and isn’t feasible for large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **TPOT can recommend different solutions for the same dataset**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're working with a reasonably complex dataset or run TPOT for a short amount of time, different TPOT runs may result in different pipeline recommendations. When two TPOT runs recommend different pipelines, this means that the TPOT runs didn't converge due to lack of time or that multiple pipelines perform more-or-less the same on your dataset. If that is the case, you can always use the __voting__ mechanism in the __ensemble learning__ to combine the models together.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Hurray! You have come to the end of this tutorial. You started with a little introduction about the idea behind Automated Machine Learning platforms. Then you explored a bit on Genetic Programming and how TPOT uses it to automate the machine learning pipeline building process. You also practiced using the TPOT library in Python on a dataset along with gaining knowledge about the functions it provides. If you plan to use TPOT in the future, I strongly suggest you look at its excellent [documentation](http://epistasislab.github.io/tpot/). Happy Exploring!\n",
